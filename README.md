MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-System

This a handwritten digit recognition system which is trained on the famous MNIST Dataset which has close to 70000 handwritten digit images and corresponding labels

I used Deep Neural Network to train the model and achived close to 92% accuracy while predicting on new data by the trained model which is saved as .h5 file

The project also has streamlit UI in which we used the saved pretrained model to make predictions on new data that user can upload in the streamlit UI page and make predictions
